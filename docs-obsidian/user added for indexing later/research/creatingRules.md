# Key Tips for Cursor .mdc Rules



## Rule Structure Best Practices



### Frontmatter Format



- **Required Fields**: Every .mdc file must start with frontmatter

  ```

  ---

  description: Use ACTION TRIGGER OUTCOME format (e.g., WHEN X occurs THEN do Y)

  globs: Pattern for files where rule applies (e.g., src/**/*.py)

  ---

  ```

- **Description Format**: Use deterministic ACTION TRIGGER OUTCOME format for

  clarity

- **Globs**: Use standard glob patterns without quotes (e.g.,

  `*.js, src/**/*.ts`)



### XML Content Structure



- **Version Tag**: Always include version in format X.Y.Z

  (`<version>1.0.0</version>`)

- **Context Section**: Explain when and where the rule applies

- **Requirements Section**: List actionable items clearly

- **Examples Section**: Include both good and bad examples



### XML Formatting Rules



- Use descriptive, full-word XML tag names (never abbreviate)

- All XML tags must have proper opening and closing tags

- Empty tags should use self-closing syntax (`<tag/>`)

- Indent content within tags by 2 spaces

- Use consistent casing for tag names (prefer lowercase)

- Related tags should follow consistent naming patterns

- For collections, use plural container with singular item tags



## Naming Conventions



### File Naming System



- Use PREFIX-name.mdc pattern for all rule files

- Common prefixes:

  - `0XXX`: Global Knowledge Management

  - `1XXX`: Language rules

  - `2XXX`: Framework rules

  - `3XXX`: Testing standards

  - `4XXX`: Obsidian rules/Documentation Rules


  - `5XXX`: MCP rules







  - `9XXX`: rules for the rules



## Content Optimization



### AI-Friendly Design



- Keep rules as short as possible without sacrificing clarity

- Use hierarchical structure for quick parsing

- Maintain high information density with minimal tokens

- Focus on machine-actionable instructions over human explanations

- Keep frontmatter description under 120 characters while maintaining clear

  intent

- Limit examples to essential patterns only



### Sectioning for Clarity



- Divide longer rules into titled sections to help the model distinguish between

  different instructions

- XML tags work well for organizing sections

- Wrap instructions in semantic tags like `<role>`, `<requirements>`,

  `<examples>`

- Key sections to consider:

  - `<context>`: When the rule applies

  - `<requirements>`: What must be done

  - `<examples>`: How to implement correctly

  - `<anti-patterns>`: What to avoid



## Effectiveness Tips



### Trigger Optimization



- Make trigger conditions specific and unambiguous

- Use multiple trigger keywords when appropriate

- Consider combining text triggers with file pattern matches



### Clear Expectations



- Specify exactly what actions should result from the rule

- Include step-by-step instructions when processes are complex

- Use ordered lists for sequential steps and unordered lists for options



### Reinforcement Elements



- Include both positive reinforcement (benefits of following the rule)

- Add negative reinforcement (consequences of not following the rule)

- Use specific examples to illustrate both good and bad practices



### Testing and Refinement



- Test rules in isolation to ensure they trigger as expected

- Test rules in combination to check for conflicts

- Refine rules based on actual usage patterns



## Rule System Integration



### Rule Priority



- Rules are combined but can sometimes conflict

- Lower prefix numbers generally indicate higher priority

- More specific glob patterns typically take precedence over general ones



### Modularity



- Break complex rule sets into multiple focused rules

- Design rules to be complementary rather than overlapping

- Consider rule dependencies and interactions



## Examples of Effective Rule Components



### Clear Trigger Condition



```xml

<activation>

  <keyword>memory bank update</keyword>

  <action>Review and update all memory bank files</action>

</activation>

```



### Step-by-Step Instructions



```xml

<procedure>

  <step>Review current context</step>

  <step>Identify changes needed</step>

  <step>Make updates preserving critical information</step>

  <step>Verify completeness</step>

</procedure>

```



### Good/Bad Examples



```xml

<examples>

  <good-practice>

    <description>Properly structured rule</description>

    <example>

      <rule>Use descriptive names for all functions</rule>

      <implementation>function calculateTotalPrice() { ... }</implementation>

    </example>

  </good-practice>

  <bad-practice>

    <description>Poor rule structure</description>

    <example>

      <rule>Use good names</rule>

      <implementation>function calc() { ... }</implementation>

    </example>

  </bad-practice>

</examples>

```
