# MCP Core Layer Technical Documentation

## 1. Overview

The MCP Core Layer is the central processing unit of our MCP microservices ecosystem. It receives incoming MCP requests (converted by the Proxy Connection Server into stdio format), validates and processes these requests, and then dispatches them to the Adapter/Registry Layer. Finally, it aggregates responses from various tool servers and passes the final result back to the Proxy, which then converts the response back to SSE for delivery to the MCP Client (e.g., Cursor).

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Request Reception and Validation:**
  Accepts stdio-formatted requests, validates input, and logs key metrics.
- **Dispatching and Routing:**
  Uses a registry to determine the appropriate tool server (Python or TypeScript) via the Adapter/Registry Layer.
- **Response Aggregation:**
  Collects and formats responses from the tool servers before forwarding them.
- **Configuration Management:**
  Loads and manages configuration settings from environment variables, config files, or command-line arguments.

## 2. Architecture & Components

The MCP Core Layer is implemented in Python and is organized into several key modules:

### 2.1 Main Application Entry Point (`app.py`)

- **Purpose:**
  Acts as the starting point for the core service. Initializes logging, loads configuration, and sets up request handlers.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `main()`: Bootstraps the core service.
  - `handle_request()`: Validates and processes incoming requests.

### 2.2 Configuration Management (`config.py`)

- **Purpose:**
  Centralizes all configuration-related logic.
- **Features:**
  - Loads environment variables and configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON).
  - Provides default values and validation of configuration parameters.
- **Usage:**
  The core uses `config.py` to determine parameters such as port numbers, logging levels, and adapter-specific settings.

### 2.3 Registry/Fascade (`registry.py`)

- **Purpose:**
  Maintains a mapping of available tool servers and their capabilities.
- **Features:**
  - Dynamically registers available tool servers.
  - Provides lookup methods to identify whether a request should be routed to a Python or TypeScript adapter.
- **Benefits:**
  Decouples the core logic from the specifics of each tool server, enabling easier extension and maintenance.

### 2.4 Adapter/Registry Layer (`adapters/`)

- **Overview:**
  This layer abstracts the differences between tool servers. It consists of:

  - **Base Adapter (`base_adapter.py`):**
    Defines the common interface and expected behaviors for all adapters.
  - **Python Adapter (`python_adapter.py`):**
    Implements adapter functionality for Python-based tool servers using the Python MCP SDK.
  - **TypeScript Adapter (`ts_adapter.py`):**
    Bridges MCP core requests to TypeScript tool servers (e.g., via REST/RPC).

- **Role in the System:**
  Acts as the mediator between the core service and the individual tool servers. It encapsulates the conversion logic, ensuring that requests and responses adhere to the MCP protocol without exposing the core to implementation details.

## 3. Request Lifecycle

The request lifecycle in the MCP Core Layer follows these steps:

1. **Reception:**
   The Proxy Connection Server converts an incoming SSE request to stdio format and passes it to the core’s `app.py`.

2. **Validation & Preprocessing:**

   - The core validates the incoming request (e.g., correct structure, mandatory fields).
   - Preprocessing might include logging, request normalization, and enriching the request with additional context.

3. **Dispatching:**

   - The core uses `registry.py` to determine which adapter should handle the request.
   - The request is passed to the corresponding adapter (either Python or TypeScript) within the Adapter/Registry Layer.

4. **Routing to Tool Servers:**

   - The adapter transforms the request into a format suitable for the target tool server.
   - For Python tool servers, it routes to the appropriate submodule (e.g., n1 for Obsidian Tool or n2 for AIChemist Tool).
   - For TypeScript tool servers, it routes to submodules (e.g., n3 for Thinking Tool or n4 for Another Tool).

5. **Response Aggregation:**

   - Each tool server processes its assigned task and returns a response.
   - The adapter aggregates responses from submodules, ensuring consistency with the MCP protocol.

6. **Final Response Handling:**
   - The core receives the aggregated response from the adapter.
   - It performs any final formatting or logging before sending the response back to the Proxy Connection Server.
   - The Proxy converts the response back to SSE and delivers it to the MCP Client.

## 4. Error Handling & Logging

- **Error Detection:**

  - The core layer includes robust validation to catch malformed requests early.
  - Exception handling is applied both at the request processing and adapter invocation stages.

- **Logging:**

  - All incoming requests, responses, and errors are logged using Python’s logging module.
  - Logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) are configurable via `config.py`.

- **Fallback Mechanisms:**
  - If an adapter fails to route a request, the core logs the error and returns a standardized error response, ensuring that the MCP Client receives a clear indication of failure.

---

## 5. Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing:**

  - Each module (e.g., `config.py`, `registry.py`, and individual adapters) should have corresponding unit tests.

- **Integration Testing:**

  - Integration tests in the `tests/integration_tests/` directory cover the full request lifecycle—from the core receiving a request to aggregating responses from tool servers.

- **Type Checking and Linting:**

  - The project uses `mypy`, `ruff`, and other linters (configured in `pyproject.toml`) to ensure code quality.

- **Coverage:**
  - Code coverage is maintained through a coverage tool (as defined in the repository’s `codecov.yml`), ensuring that critical paths in the core layer are well-tested.

## 6. Deployment and Usage

**Running Locally (Without Docker):**

- Launch the MCP Core service from its source directory:
  ```bash
  cd src/mcp_core
  python app.py
  ```
- The core service reads its configuration from `config.py` and starts listening for requests from the proxy.

**Integration with the Proxy:**

- The Proxy Connection Server (located in `src/mcp_proxy/__main__.py`) sends converted requests (stdio) to the core.
- The core processes these requests as described, with its output being sent back through the proxy.

**Configuration Overrides:**

- Users can override configuration parameters via environment variables or command-line arguments, as defined in `config.py`. This makes it flexible for different deployment environments.

## Conclusion

The MCP Core Layer is designed to be the centralized hub for processing MCP requests, managing configurations, and delegating tasks to various tool servers via a robust adapter/registry system. This design not only simplifies future maintenance and scaling but also ensures that the system can integrate diverse technologies seamlessly. This documentation serves as a living document that should be updated as the core layer evolves or as new requirements emerge.
