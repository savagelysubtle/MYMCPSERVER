# List Organization

This directory manages sequential relationships and ordered lists across the documentation.

## Implementation Sequences

### MCP Server Implementation

```yaml
name: "MCP Server Setup"
type: "sequence"
items:
  - name: "Core Setup"
    doc: "[[../mcpKnowledge/development/Hub Setup Guide]]"
    next: "Transport Setup"
  - name: "Transport Setup"
    doc: "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/transport/overview-v2]]"
    next: "Tool Registration"
  - name: "Tool Registration"
    doc: "[[../mcpKnowledge/core/Tool Management]]"
    next: "Integration"
  - name: "Integration"
    doc: "[[../mcpKnowledge/integration/Cursor Integration]]"
```

### Development Process

```yaml
name: "Development Workflow"
type: "sequence"
items:
  - name: "Environment Setup"
    doc: "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/Server Configuration]]"
    next: "Core Implementation"
  - name: "Core Implementation"
    doc: "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/core/overview-v2]]"
    next: "Tool Development"
  - name: "Tool Development"

    next: "Testing"
  - name: "Testing"
    doc: "[[../projects/myMcpServer/testing/Test Plan]]"
```

## Hierarchical Lists

### Architecture Components

```yaml
name: "System Architecture"
type: "hierarchy"
items:
  - name: "Transport Layer"
    doc: "[[../projects/myMcpServer/architecture/System Overview]]"
    contains:
      - "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/transport/technical-v2]]"
      - "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/transport/overview-v2]]"
  - name: "Core Layer"
    doc: "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/core/overview-v2]]"

  - name: "Tool Layer"
    doc: "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/python/tool-server]]"
    contains:
      - "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/typescript/tool-server]]"
```

### Documentation Structure

```yaml

    contains:
      - "[[../projects/myMcpServer/architecture/_index]]"
      - "[[../projects/myMcpServer/implementation/_index]]"
```

## Dependency Lists

### Core Dependencies

```yaml
name: "Core System Dependencies"
type: "dependencies"
items:
  - name: "Transport Layer"
    requires: []
    required_by: ["Core Layer"]
  - name: "Core Layer"
    requires: ["Transport Layer"]
    required_by: ["Tool Layer"]
  - name: "Tool Layer"
    requires: ["Core Layer"]
    required_by: []
```

### Implementation Dependencies

```yaml
name: "Implementation Dependencies"
type: "dependencies"
items:
  - name: "Server Configuration"
    requires: []
    required_by: ["Core Implementation"]

    required_by: ["Tool Implementation"]
  - name: "Tool Implementation"
    requires: ["Core Implementation"]
    required_by: []
```

## List Views

### Implementation Sequence

```dataview
TABLE next as "Next Step"
FROM [[lists/_index]]
WHERE type = "sequence"
SORT file.name ASC
```

### Component Hierarchy

```dataview
TABLE contains as "Contains"
FROM [[lists/_index]]
WHERE type = "hierarchy"
SORT file.name ASC
```

### System Dependencies

```dataview
TABLE requires as "Requires", required_by as "Required By"
FROM [[lists/_index]]
WHERE type = "dependencies"
SORT file.name ASC
```
