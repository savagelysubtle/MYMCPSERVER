# Creating a New Note

## Overview
This guide walks through the process of creating a new note using our template system and properly integrating it into the knowledge graph.

## Steps

### 1. Create the Note
1. Use the template shortcut or click on the template in the quick links from [[Home]]
2. Name your note with a descriptive title that captures the main idea
3. By default, new notes are linked to the [[Fleeting MOC]]

### 2. Fill in the Content
1. Complete the Overview section with a brief description
2. Add Key Points as bullet points for easy scanning
3. Fill in the Details section with comprehensive information
4. Link to related notes where appropriate

### 3. Organize and Link
1. Decide which MOC this note belongs to
2. Replace the link to [[Fleeting MOC]] with the appropriate MOC
3. Add contextual links to related notes in the Related Notes section
4. Ensure bidirectional linking by editing related notes to link back

## Tips for Effective Notes
- Keep notes atomic (one main idea per note)
- Use descriptive titles that will make sense in a link
- Add tags for additional organization and findability
- Link generously but meaningfully to related ideas
