# System Overview

## Architecture Overview

The MCP (Machine Comprehension Platform) is designed as a modular, extensible system that connects AI clients with specialized tool servers using a layered architecture approach. This architecture enables seamless communication between different components while maintaining separation of concerns.

## System Components

### 1. Transport Layer

**Proxy Connection Server (stdio ⇄ SSE)**

- Bridges different transport protocols
- Converts between SSE (client-facing) and stdio (internal)
- Components:
  - Transport Manager
  - Protocol Adapters
  - Health Endpoints

**Key Features:**

- Protocol adaptation
- Connection management
- Error handling with structured logging
- Health status reporting

### 2. Core Processing Layer

**MCP Core Layer (Python)**

- Central processing unit of the system
- Handles core business logic and request dispatching
- Components:
  - Request Validator
  - Metrics Collector
  - Config Manager

**Key Features:**

- Centralized configuration system
- Structured error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Registry/Adapter Layer

**Adapter/Registry Layer**

- Routes MCP requests to appropriate tool servers
- Provides abstraction for tool implementation details
- Components:
  - Version Manager
  - Circuit Breaker
  - Health Monitor

**Key Features:**

- Dynamic tool registration
- Request routing logic
- Response aggregation
- Error handling for failed tool requests

### 4. Tool Server Layer

**Python Tool Server**

- Implements Python-based tool functionalities
- Houses specialized tools (Obsidian Tool, AIChemist Tool)
- Provides Python SDK for tool development

**TypeScript Tool Server**

- Implements TypeScript-based tool functionalities
- Houses specialized tools (Thinking Tool, etc.)
- Provides TypeScript SDK for tool development

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 1. Configuration Management

- Unified configuration system
- Environment variable support
- Configuration file handling
- Sensible defaults

### 2. Error Handling

- Standardized error types
- Formatted error responses
- Contextual information
- Error propagation

### 3. Logging and Monitoring

- JSON-structured logging
- Contextual metadata
- Log levels
- Performance metrics

### 4. Health Checks

- Service status reporting
- Dependency health monitoring
- System diagnostics
- Automated verification

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**
   - MCP Client sends request via SSE
   - Proxy Connection Server receives request

2. **Protocol Conversion**
   - SSE request converted to stdio format
   - Forwarded to MCP Core Layer

3. **Request Processing**
   - Core Layer validates request
   - Dispatches to Adapter/Registry Layer

4. **Tool Routing**
   - Adapter determines appropriate tool server
   - Routes request to Python or TypeScript server

5. **Tool Execution**
   - Tool server processes request
   - Executes business logic
   - Generates results

6. **Response Aggregation**
   - Results flow back through tool servers
   - Adapter aggregates responses
   - Core Layer formats final response

7. **Response Delivery**
   - Proxy converts response to SSE format
   - Client receives formatted response

## Implementation Benefits

- **Modularity**: Independent component development
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools
- **Protocol Independence**: Flexible transport protocols
- **Technology Flexibility**: Multiple language support
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring
- **Resilience**: Robust error handling
- **Scalability**: Independent component scaling
