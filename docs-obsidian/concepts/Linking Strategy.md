# Linking Strategy

## Overview
A linking strategy defines how notes are connected to create a robust and useful knowledge graph in your documentation system.

## Key Points
- Effective linking creates a discoverable knowledge network
- Links should be meaningful, not just mechanical
- Different types of links serve different purposes
- Bidirectional linking ensures connections work both ways

## Details
Linking in Obsidian is more than just connecting notes—it's about building a network of ideas that enhances understanding and discovery. A good linking strategy includes:

### Types of Links
- **Direct links**: Explicit connections between closely related notes
- **Contextual links**: Links with surrounding text explaining the relationship
- **Sequential links**: Links forming a linear path through related ideas
- **Conceptual bridges**: Links connecting seemingly unrelated ideas

### Best Practices
1. **Be selective**: Quality over quantity—only link what truly belongs together
2. **Add context**: Explain why notes are connected when not obvious
3. **Be bidirectional**: Ensure important connections work both ways
4. **Keep source links**: Always maintain connections to original sources
