# Knowledge Graph

## Overview
A knowledge graph is a network of interlinked descriptions of concepts, entities, relationships and events that gives context and meaning to information.

## Key Points
- Knowledge graphs represent information as nodes and edges
- They enable powerful connections between ideas
- In Obsidian, the graph view visualizes your knowledge graph
- Bi-directional linking forms the foundation of knowledge graphs

## Details
In a knowledge management system like Obsidian, the knowledge graph forms through intentional linking between notes. As more connections are created, the value of the knowledge base increases exponentially.

The power of knowledge graphs comes from their ability to surface non-obvious connections and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden in a linear organization system.
