# MOC Concept

## Overview
Maps of Content (MOCs) are special notes that act as navigation hubs for specific topics in your knowledge management system.

## Key Points
- MOCs are curated collections of links to related notes
- They function as both indexes and workbenches for ideas
- MOCs can evolve as your understanding of a topic grows
- They reduce friction in knowledge organization

## Details
Maps of Content were pioneered by Nick Milo as part of his Linking Your Thinking framework. They serve multiple functions in a knowledge management system:

1. **As incubators**: Places to collect related notes and let ideas develop
2. **As workbenches**: Spaces to organize and rearrange ideas in fluid ways
3. **As summations**: Providing overviews and synthesis of a topic

Unlike rigid folder structures, MOCs allow notes to exist in multiple contexts simultaneously through linking rather than containment.
