# Knowledge Graph

## Overview

A knowledge graph is a network of interlinked descriptions of concepts, entities, relationships and events that gives context and meaning to information. In our documentation system, it represents the connections between different pieces of knowledge across MCP concepts, implementation details, and development guides.

## Key Points

- Knowledge graphs represent information as nodes and edges
- They enable powerful connections between ideas
- In Obsidian, the graph view visualizes your knowledge graph
- Bi-directional linking forms the foundation of knowledge graphs

## Implementation

### Directory Structure

Our knowledge graph is organized into main categories:

1. **MCP Knowledge** ([[../mcpKnowledge/README|Overview]])
   - Core concepts
   - SDK documentation
   - Integration guides

2. **Project Documentation** ([[../projects/myMcpServer/README|Overview]])
   - Implementation details
   - Architecture documents
   - Planning materials

3. **Language Knowledge** ([[../languages/README|Overview]])
   - Python development
   - TypeScript development

### Connection Types

1. **Hierarchical**
   - Parent-child relationships
   - Category organization
   - Topic grouping

2. **Cross-Reference**
   - Related concepts
   - Implementation examples
   - Supporting documentation

3. **Contextual**
   - Use cases
   - Examples
   - Applications

## Best Practices

### Creating Connections

1. **Meaningful Links**
   - Link related concepts
   - Explain relationships
   - Provide context

2. **Organization**
   - Use MOCs as hubs
   - Maintain hierarchies
   - Create clear paths

3. **Maintenance**
   - Review connections
   - Update broken links
   - Add new relationships
