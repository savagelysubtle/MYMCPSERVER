# Sequential Thinking Tools Integration

## Overview

The MCP Sequential Thinking Tools is a specialized server that helps break down complex problems into manageable steps and provides intelligent tool recommendations for each stage of problem-solving.

## Features

- 🤔 Dynamic problem-solving through sequential thoughts
- 🛠️ Intelligent tool recommendations
- 📊 Confidence scoring for suggestions
- 🔍 Detailed rationale for recommendations
- 📝 Progress tracking
- 🔄 Support for branching and revision

## Installation

The server is configured in the MCP configuration file (`.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-sequentialthinking-tools": {
      "command": "powershell.exe",
      "args": [
        "-ExecutionPolicy",
        "Bypass",
        "-Command",
        "npx -y mcp-sequentialthinking-tools"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

The server provides a single tool `sequentialthinking_tools` with the following parameters:

- `thought` (string, required): Current thinking step
- `next_thought_needed` (boolean): Whether another step is needed
- `thought_number` (integer): Current thought number
- `total_thoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed
- `is_revision` (boolean): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `current_step` (object): Current step recommendation

### Example Response

```json
{
  "thought": "Initial research step",
  "current_step": {
    "step_description": "Gather initial information",
    "expected_outcome": "Clear understanding of concept",
    "recommended_tools": [
      {
        "tool_name": "search_docs",
        "confidence": 0.9,
        "rationale": "Search documentation for information",
        "priority": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
