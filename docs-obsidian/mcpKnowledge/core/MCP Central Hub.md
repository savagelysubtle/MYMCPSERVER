# MCP Central Hub

## Overview

A central hub MCP server functions as a unified management system for multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It provides a single point of configuration, coordination, and access for diverse MCP tools while respecting Cursor's tool limit constraints.

## Key Features

- Centralized configuration management
- Unified deployment process
- Modular architecture
- Tool categorization and organization
- Authentication and access control
- Monitoring and health checking

## Core Components

- **Configuration Manager**: Centralizes MCP server settings into a single configuration
- **Server Orchestrator**: Handles startup, shutdown, and coordination of individual MCP servers
- **Tool Registry**: Maintains metadata about available tools across all integrated servers
- **Connection Manager**: Manages connections between Cursor and individual MCP servers
- **Logging System**: Provides unified logging across all integrated servers
