# MVP Execution Plan for MYMCPSERVER

**Objective:** Execute the steps outlined in `MVP_GUIDE.md` to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) state for the MYMCPSERVER project.

**Instructions for Agent:** Follow the steps below in sequence. If a step explicitly states "PAUSE: Request assistance from a reasoning model", stop execution and notify the user to switch tasks to a more capable AI model for that specific step. Resume with the next step once the complex task is completed. Execute commands from the **project root directory** unless specified otherwise.

## 1. SDK Alignment and Verification

### Step 1.1: Verify Dependency Versions

**Action:** Run the following command in the terminal within the project's virtual environment to check installed `mcp` package versions.
**Command:**

```powershell
uv pip list | Select-String "mcp"
```

**Expected Outcome:** Output showing the installed versions of `mcp` and related packages (like `fastmcp`).

**Action:** Compare the output versions with the requirements mentioned in `@src/chemist_server/mcp_core/app.py` and SDK documentation (ideally `0.4.0+`). Ensure the version specification in `@pyproject.toml` (e.g., `mcp[cli] = ">=0.4.0"`) aligns with the verified compatible version.
**PAUSE:** Request assistance from a reasoning model to analyze version compatibility and update the version specifier in `@pyproject.toml` if necessary, based on the verification.

### Step 1.2: Confirm SDK Imports

**Action:** Manually inspect the file `@src/chemist_server/mcp_core/app.py`.
**PAUSE:** Request assistance from a reasoning model to verify that imports like `Context`, `FastMCP`, `ServerSession` align with the structure and exports of the installed MCP SDK version (identified in Step 1.1). The reasoning model may need to consult the specific SDK version\'s documentation if available or infer from the installed package structure.

## 2. Essential Testing for MVP

### Step 2.1: Create Test Directory Structure (skip already exists)

**Action:** Create the `unit`, `integration`, and `fixtures` subdirectories within the root `tests` directory.
**Commands:**

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "tests/unit"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "tests/integration"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "tests/fixtures"
```

**Expected Outcome:** The directory structure `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/fixtures/` now exists at the project root.

### Step 2.2: Implement Unit Tests

**PAUSE:** Request assistance from a reasoning model to create the following unit test files within the root `@tests/unit/` directory and implement the tests as described in `MVP_GUIDE.md`, Section 4. This involves significant code writing and mocking.

- `test_config.py`
- `test_logger.py`
- `test_registry.py`
- `test_command_tools.py`
- `test_cli_tools.py`
- `test_git_tools.py`

### Step 2.3: Implement Integration Tests

**PAUSE:** Request assistance from a reasoning model to create the following integration test files within the root `@tests/integration/` directory and implement the tests as described in `MVP_GUIDE.md`, Section 4. This involves code writing, potentially setting up test environments, and interacting with the application components.

- `test_cli_execution.py`
- `test_app_startup.py`
- `test_tool_invocation.py` (Note: This is marked as potentially complex).

### Step 2.4: Create Test Fixtures

**PAUSE:** Request assistance from a reasoning model to create necessary pytest fixtures within the root `@tests/fixtures/` directory (e.g., in a `tests/conftest.py` or specific fixture files) as outlined in `MVP_GUIDE.md`, Section 4. This involves understanding pytest fixture patterns and the needs of the unit/integration tests.

## 3. Code Style and Documentation for MVP

### Step 3.1: Apply Linter/Formatter

**Action:** Verify that `ruff` configuration exists in `@pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`. (Verified: Configuration exists).
**Action:** Run the following commands from the **project root** directory to apply formatting and linting fixes.
**Commands:**

```powershell
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

**Expected Outcome:** Code formatting and style issues are automatically corrected across the project (`src`, `tests`, `scripts`, `pyproject.toml` as configured). Address any errors reported by the tools that require manual intervention.

### Step 3.2: Add/Improve Docstrings

**PAUSE:** Request assistance from a reasoning model to add or improve docstrings for all public classes and functions within the `@src/chemist_server/` directory and its subdirectories, following the guidelines in `MVP_GUIDE.md`, Section 5. This requires understanding the code\'s purpose and adhering to a standard docstring format (e.g., Google style).

### Step 3.3: Update README.md

**PAUSE:** Request assistance from a reasoning model to update the main project `@README.md` file. Ensure it includes clear, concise instructions on:

1.  Setting up the Python environment using `uv sync`.
2.  Configuring the server (mentioning `.env.local`).
3.  Running the MVP server (e.g., using `python -m chemist_server`). Verify this command works or update based on the actual package structure and entry points. Consider mentioning the `mcp-server` script defined in `pyproject.toml` if it's the intended way to run the server.

**Completion:** Once all steps (including those handled by the reasoning model) are successfully completed, the MYMCPSERVER project will have reached its defined MVP state.
