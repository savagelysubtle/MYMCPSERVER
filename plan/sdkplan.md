Okay, I can help with that. I will conduct a comprehensive review of your `mymcpserver` codebase based on the MCP Python SDK, MCP documentation, and the custom instructions you've provided, focusing on MVP relevance.

To do this effectively, I need to examine the code files. I'll start by reading the main configuration and entry point files.



Read file: src/chemist_server/mcp_core/errors.py

Read file: src/chemist_server/mcp_core/app.py

Read file: src/chemist_server/config.py

Read file: src/chemist_server/server.py
Okay, I have reviewed the core components of your `mymcpserver` codebase (`errors.py`, `app.py`, `config.py`, `server.py`) based on the provided context (MCP SDK, documentation, custom instructions, and project files).

Here is a detailed report of the findings, focusing on aspects relevant to the MVP stage:

## MYMCPSERVER Code Review Report (MVP Focus)

**Overall:** The codebase demonstrates a good structure, leveraging modern Python features like `anyio`, `pydantic-settings`, and type hinting. It adheres well to the specified logging rules by using a `StructuredLogger`. Configuration management is robust. A recent refactoring appears to have integrated tools directly into the core service, simplifying the architecture for a single-process deployment. The most critical issue found relates to how MCP context is passed to tool implementations.

**Issues & Recommendations:**

| `src/chemist_server/mcp_core/app.py` (Lines ~107, 143, 173, 200, 227) | Tool wrapper functions (e.g., `run_command_wrapper`) accept the `ctx: Context` argument from `FastMCP` but then call the underlying tool implementation (e.g., `run_command`) passing `ctx=None`. This prevents the actual tools from accessing MCP context features like `ctx.info`, `ctx.report_progress`, `ctx.read_resource`, etc. | **Critical** | Modify the underlying tool functions (in `cli_tools.py`, `git_tools.py`, etc.) to accept the `ctx: Context` parameter. Update the wrappers in `app.py` to pass the received `ctx` object to these underlying functions. Ensure tools utilize `ctx` where appropriate (e.g., for logging). | Critical Error  |
| `src/chemist_server/server.py` (Lines ~53-56)   | The `start_core_service` function assumes `app.run_sse_async()` implicitly reads host/port from the config when using SSE/HTTP transport. While possibly true, relying on implicit behavior is less clear and potentially brittle. | Low        | Verify the signature of `FastMCP.run_sse_async()` (or the underlying ASGI server runner it uses, like `uvicorn.run`). If it accepts `host` and `port` arguments, explicitly pass `host=config.get_core_host()` and `port=config.get_core_port()` for clarity and robustness.                 | Recommendation  |
| `src/chemist_server/mcp_core/app.py` (General)  | Tool wrappers currently return `dict[str, Any]`. While acceptable for an early MVP, using specific Pydantic models for tool inputs (already done via type hints in decorators) and *outputs* would provide better validation, type safety, and clarity for the LLM client. | Medium     | Define Pydantic models for the expected return structures of each tool (e.g., `GitStatusResult`, `CommandOutput`). Update the return type hints in the wrapper functions (e.g., `-> GitStatusResult`) and ensure the underlying tools return instances of these models.                | Recommendation  |
| `src/chemist_server/mcp_core/errors.py` (Line 79) | The `CircuitBreakerError` explicitly sets `self.code = "CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ERROR"` after calling `super().__init__`, while other custom errors rely on the `code` passed to the base `MCPError` during their `__init__`. This is a minor inconsistency. | Low        | Either pass the specific code directly in the `super().__init__` call for `CircuitBreakerError` (like other errors) or adopt the pattern of setting `self.code` afterwards for all custom errors if more complex logic is needed. Choose one approach for consistency.                     | Recommendation  |
| Project Root (`src/`)                           | While a manual review suggests good adherence to coding standards, a full linting pass hasn't been explicitly run as part of this review. Hidden issues might exist.          | Medium     | Run `ruff check .` and `ruff format .` (or equivalent commands based on your workflow, possibly via `uv run lint`) within the `src` directory to automatically identify and potentially fix any remaining linting or formatting issues according to the rules defined in `pyproject.toml`. | Linting Error   |
| `src/chemist_server/config.py` (Comment)        | A comment mentions `CoreConfig` is simplified here to avoid circular imports and the full version is in `mcp_core/config/config.py`. This implies potential duplication or divergence. | Low        | Review the structure in `mcp_core/config/config.py` (if it exists). Consolidate the `CoreConfig` definition into a single location if possible, perhaps in a base config module imported by both `chemist_server/config.py` and the core logic, to avoid duplication.                | Recommendation  |
| `src/chemist_server/mcp_core/app.py` (Lines 256, 262) | Placeholder/test tools `core_add_tool` and `core_health_tool` are present.                                                                                              | Info       | Review the purpose of these tools. Remove them if they are just for testing and no longer needed for the MVP functionality. Keep the health check if it provides actual value.                                                                                                | Recommendation  |

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Address the Critical `ctx` Passing Issue:** This is the highest priority as it directly impacts the usability of tools within the MCP framework.
2.  **Run Linters:** Execute `ruff` to catch any deviations from your defined style guide.
3.  **Consider Recommendations:** Evaluate the medium and low-priority recommendations based on your MVP timeline and goals. Implementing Pydantic models for tool outputs is highly recommended for robustness.
4.  **Verify `run_sse_async`:** Confirm how host/port should be passed for SSE transport.

Let me know when you're ready to address these points or if you'd like me to proceed with implementing any specific changes!


Okay, let's continue the review.

First, I'll look at the `python-sdk` directory you've included in your workspace. Then I'll dive deeper into the remaining parts of your `mymcpserver` codebase.

**1. Reviewing the `python-sdk` Directory**

*   **Observation:** The directory `/d:/Coding/Python_Projects/MYMCPSERVER/python-sdk` appears to be a direct checkout or copy of the official `modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` repository. Its `pyproject.toml` and file structure (`src/mcp`, `examples`, `tests`, `docs`) match the standard SDK layout.
*   **Dependency Management:** Your main project's `pyproject.toml` (`/d:/Coding/Python_Projects/MYMCPSERVER/pyproject.toml`) correctly lists `mcp[cli]>=1.6.0,<2.0.0` as a dependency.
*   **Recommendation (Low Severity):** It's generally recommended to rely *solely* on the package manager (`uv` in this case) to manage dependencies like the `mcp` SDK, rather than keeping a local copy in the project structure. The local copy can lead to confusion about which version is actually being used (the one installed in the virtual environment by `uv`, or the local files). It also risks accidental local modifications that won't be tracked or easily updated. Consider removing the `python-sdk` directory from your project root unless you have a specific reason for modifying the SDK directly (which should be avoided if possible). If it's just for reference, that's okay, but be mindful not to import directly from it.

**2. Reviewing `mymcpserver/src/chemist_server/tool_servers`**

I need to see the contents of the tool server directories to understand their structure.


Ran tool

Ran tool

Ran tool
*   **Observation:** You have separate directories for Python (`cliTool`, `mem0-mcp`) and TypeScript tool implementations.
*   **`cliTool`:** Contains `cli_tools.py`, `git_tools.py`, `command_tools.py`, and a `cli_tool_registry.py`. This seems well-organized for command-line and Git-related functionality.
*   **`typescript_tool_server`:** Contains a standard Node.js/TypeScript project structure (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src`).
*   **Previous Finding Integration:** My earlier finding about the refactoring integrating tools directly into the core service (`mcp_core/app.py`) seems partially complete. The wrappers exist in `app.py`, but the actual tool code still resides here in `tool_servers`. This is not necessarily an *issue*, but confirms the structure. The critical point remains passing the `ctx` object correctly from the wrappers in `app.py` to the implementations in `cli_tools.py` and `git_tools.py`.
*   **Redundancy Check (`cli_tool_registry.py`):** The file `cli_tool_registry.py` might be redundant now if tools are registered directly in `mcp_core/app.py` using `@app.tool()` decorators. I need to check its contents and how it's used.


Read file: src/chemist_server/tool_servers/python_tool_server/cliTool/cli_tool_registry.py
*   **Redundancy Confirmed:** Yes, `cli_tool_registry.py` defines a `CLI_TOOLS` list and a `register_tools` function that seem designed for a different registration approach (perhaps iterating and calling a hypothetical `server.register_tool` method). Since `mcp_core/app.py` uses the `@app.tool()` decorator method provided by `FastMCP`, this registry file and its functions (`register_tools`, `get_tool_definitions`) are likely unused and can be removed to avoid confusion. The metadata (description, schema) defined here *is* valuable and has been duplicated (or should be) in the `@app.tool` decorators in `app.py`.
*   **TypeScript Server:** Without seeing the code inside `typescript_tool_server/src`, I can't review its specific implementation. However, the critical question is how it's integrated. Is it intended to run as a separate process that the main Python server communicates with (e.g., via HTTP or another IPC mechanism)? If so, the main Python server (`mcp_core/app.py`) would need logic to act as a *proxy* for these TypeScript tools, which isn't currently present. If the TypeScript server is *not* meant to be used in the current setup, it might be leftover from previous experiments.
*   **`mem0-mcp`:** This directory likely contains tools related to the `mem0ai` dependency. I need to see its contents.


Ran tool
*   **`mem0-mcp` Observation:** This looks like *another* standalone MCP server project (`main.py`, `.env`, `README.md`, `node/`) possibly cloned or included within your main project structure. Similar to the `python-sdk` directory, this shouldn't be nested directly within your `chemist_server` source unless it's actively being imported or proxied. The presence of `.git` and `.uv_cache` strongly suggests it's a separate project. How is this intended to be used? Is it run as a separate process? If so, the main `chemist_server` needs proxy logic. If not, it should likely be removed or treated as a separate dependency managed by `uv`.

**3. Reviewing `mymcpserver/src/chemist_server/mcp_core`**

Let's look at the remaining files in the core module.


Ran tool
*   **`registry.py` & `router.py`:** These files (totaling ~16KB) seem related to managing and routing tool calls. However, with the current approach of using `FastMCP`'s `@app.tool` decorators in `app.py`, the framework handles registration and routing internally. These custom `registry` and `router` modules might be remnants of a previous architecture (perhaps using the lower-level `mcp.server.Server`) or an attempt to build a proxy layer. Given the direct registration in `app.py`, their current necessity is questionable and they might be adding unused complexity.
*   **`adapters/`:** This directory likely contained code for communicating with separate tool server processes (like the Python or TypeScript ones). Since the tools seem integrated now, this might also be largely unused.
*   **`config/`:** Contains `config.py`. As noted previously, there might be overlap with `chemist_server/config.py`. Consolidation is recommended.
*   **`models/`, `validation/`, `metrics/`:** These suggest a more complex application structure was intended or previously existed. Review their contents to see if they are still relevant to the MVP. `models` might contain the Pydantic models recommended earlier for tool outputs. `validation` could be useful. `metrics` might be overkill for an MVP unless specifically required.
*   **`health.py`:** Contains `CoreHealth` and `SystemHealth`. This looks like a reasonable implementation for health checking. The `app.py` includes a `/health` endpoint using this.

Keep what's essential for the MVP (e.g., Pydantic models for tool I/O if they exist in `models/`). Remove or defer implementation of non-essential features (like potentially complex metrics) until post-MVP.                                                                                                                                                                    | Recommendation  |

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Address Critical `ctx` Issue:** (From previous report) This remains the highest priority.
2.  **Clarify Integration Strategy:** Determine how (or if) the TypeScript and `mem0-mcp` servers are meant to be used and integrated. This will dictate whether proxy logic is needed or if these directories should be removed/relocated.
3.  **Simplify Core Logic:** Evaluate and potentially remove the redundant/unused `cli_tool_registry.py`, `registry.py`, `router.py`, and `adapters/`.
4.  **Consolidate Config:** Merge the configuration logic.
5.  **Review `models/`, `validation/`, `metrics/`:** Decide what's needed for MVP.
6.  **Run Linters:** (From previous report) Ensure code style consistency.

Let me know which of these points you'd like to tackle first. I can help implement the changes.
